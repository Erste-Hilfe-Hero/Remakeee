## What bought unlocks do in the game (plan area 10). The server is the truth: these read
## Billing.state (shop_state), which is fetched after every login. Bag items (keepsakes,
## Echo Scents, Spark Shards) work through their items.json entries like any other item.

## Coin prices at world merchants with the Merchant's Seal (item 4970).
const MERCHANT_DISCOUNT: float = 0.8

## Merchant price multiplier: 0.8 with rg_merchant_discount, else 1.0 (item 4971).
static func merchant_mult() -> float:
	return MERCHANT_DISCOUNT if Billing.unlocked("merchant_discount") > 0 else 1.0

## A merchant's coin price after the discount, never below 1.
static func merchant_price(price: int) -> int:
	if price <= 0:
		return price
	return maxi(1, int(floor(price * merchant_mult())))

## Brings the journey in line with the server's unlocks. Storage boxes only grow here: a box
## that holds Spirlings is never taken away (plan item 4597).
static func apply_unlocks() -> void:
	var boxes: int = Billing.unlocked("storage_box")
	if boxes > GameState.storage_box_bonus:
		GameState.storage_box_bonus = boxes
		GameState.ensure_boxes()
